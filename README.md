# DungeonBossGame
Just a minor disclaimer : while this program is mostly my work, some of the code was supplied for the class this was assigned for. The io.c, game.c, and game.h were the files given to use to build this game. The flavor text / weapons and armor lists were supplied as well. The rest if my own work.

To run/play, first type the "make" command when in the program directory. This compiles all files together, creating an executable that runs the game. Type "./Gauntlet" to run the game. Also, to delete the object files (.o) type the command "make clean." You will have to you will not have to "remake" the executable unless the program's source code changed. Good luck against the boss :D
