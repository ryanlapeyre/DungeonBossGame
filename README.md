# DungeonBossGame
Just a minor disclaimer: while this program is mostly my work, some of the code was supplied by the class it was assigned in. The io.c (we made a file for this earlier but its use was cannabliized into this file once the game's scale increased), game.c, and game.h, heroes.c (the bottom four functions), shop.c (bottom four functions) and fight.c were the files given to use to build this game. The weapons, armor, boss, and hero text files were supplied as well. The rest is my own work. This assignment dealt with structs, struct pointers, binary search trees and freeing them, linked lists, as well as advanced design. 

To run/play, first type the "make" command when in the program directory. This compiles all files together, creating an executable that runs the game. Type "./Gauntlet" to run the game. Also, to delete the object files (.o) and the executable file, type the command "make clean." Good luck against the boss :D
